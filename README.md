Project `Learning` for the `Exam PCED`.

At the start of creating `DataFrames` with `Python`.  
So, I made practice questions with a good friend of mine.  
Custom instances with the `Faker` are made for `Department's`.  
At least the `PCEP` exam doesnâ€™t cover this`stuff`.  
Lucky for me, now I know what they want to test on.
